        <h2 class="text-lg font-semibold">Key Issues</h2>
        <p><strong>Mistreatment and Neglect:</strong> Dogs, often used for guarding, are sometimes tied up without proper care. Cats, mainly used for rat hunting, are also neglected.</p>
        <p><strong>Stray Animal Problem:</strong> Stray dogs and cats pose public health and safety issues.</p>
        <p><strong>SOS Animaux de Compagnie Association:</strong> Established in 2008, this volunteer organization is dedicated to rescuing mistreated or abandoned animals. It provides essential veterinary care and seeks adoptive homes, primarily in mainland France.</p>
